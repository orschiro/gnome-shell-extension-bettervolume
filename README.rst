Mouse scroll wheel brightness change
====================================

I forked this extension to implement one single feature I am currently missing from default GNOME Shell brightness handling. And that feature comes from Cinnamon. On Cinnamon you can use your mouse wheel scroll over the battery icon to change the brightness level. This is what I want to achieve by forking this volume extension.

I have never created a GNOME extension. Hence, if you are an experienced extension developer, I welcome any contribution to this! Thank you. :-)
